# Requirements traceability

Every requirement from the assignment (Ludo Project.pdf), where it is implemented, and the automated test that checks it.
Tests are in `src/test/java` and run on every build (`build.bat`); the JAR is not produced if a test fails.

## Board and squares

| # | Requirement | Implementation | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Easy: 52-square loop + 6 home squares per colour | `BoardFactory.createLayout` | `BoardFactoryTest.pathLengthsMatchTheSpecification`, `trackSizesAre52Then64Then72` |

| # | Requirement | Implementation | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | 4 pieces per player, 2–4 players, unique colour and name | `Player`, `Game.Builder.build` | `setupRulesAreEnforced` |
| P2 | Capture: landing on a single opponent piece on an unprotected square sends it to its castle | `Game.captureAt` | `landingOnASingleOpponentPieceCapturesIt` |

| P6 | UltraBoost die 1–6: steps = normal × (N−1) | `UltraBoostDice` | `hardLevelUsesUltraBoostWithMultipliersUpToFive` |
| P7 | Leaving the castle uses only the normal die (6), the multiplier is ignored even if ×0; or use the multiplied value on a piece on the board | `Game.computeOptions` | `aSixWithBoostZeroStillEntersAPiece`, `aSixWithBoostOffersEnterOrTheMultipliedMove`, `aSixCanMoveAPieceAlreadyOnTheBoard` |

## Questions

| # | Requirement | Implementation | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Multiple choice, 4 answers | `Question` record validation | `invalidQuestionsAreRejected` |
| Q2 | At least 30 questions over 3 levels, from the course material | `questions-default.json` (36: 12 per level; Agile, Scrum, MVC, Design Patterns, QA, SW design, Git) | `theDefaultQuestionBankIsValidAndLargeEnough` |
| Q3 | Right answer +1/+2/+3, wrong answer −1/−2/−3 by level | `Game.answer`, `QuestionLevel.steps` | `aCorrectAnswerMovesForwardByTheQuestionLevel`, `aWrongAnswerMovesBackByTheQuestionLevel`, `aWrongAnswerNeverMovesBehindTheStartSquare`, `aCorrectAnswerStopsAtTheFinish`, `aCorrectAnswerStopsBeforeAnOpponentBlock` |

## Game rules

| # | Requirement | Implementation | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Enter only with a 6; no active pieces and a 1–5 → turn passes immediately | `Game.roll` / `computeOptions` | `aPieceLeavesTheCastleOnlyWithASix` |
| R2 | Free choice of the piece to move among legal moves | `Game.options`, `choose` | `aSixCanMoveAPieceAlreadyOnTheBoard`, `actionsAreRejectedInTheWrongPhase` |
| R3 | A 6 gives another roll; the third 6 in a row is cancelled and the turn passes | `Game.roll`, `finishAction` | `enteringPutsThePieceOnTheStartSquareAndASixGivesAnotherRoll`, `theThirdSixInARowIsCancelledAndTheTurnPasses` |
| R4 | Exact roll to finish; otherwise move another piece; if none, the turn passes | `computeOptions` | `theFinishNeedsAnExactRoll`, `tooBigARollMustBeUsedByAnotherPiece` |
| R5 | Game ends when all players but one have finished; the finishing order is recorded | `Game.checkGameOver`, `finishOrder` | `theGameEndsWhenAllPlayersButOneHaveFinished`, `computerOnlyGamesAlwaysFinishOnEveryLevel` |

## System flow (screens)

| # | Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Start screen: start a game, game history, restricted question manager | `view/StartPanel` |
| F2.1 | Choose the number of players and the level | `view/SetupPanel` |
| F2.2 | Name and unique colour per player | `view/SetupPanel` (+ `Game.Builder` validation) |
| F2.3 | Board screen shows the time, the player whose turn it is, the dice (with function), the board | `view/GamePanel`, `BoardCanvas`, `DiceView` |
| F2.4 | Play from start to finish with questions, surprises and safe squares | `controller/GameController` |
| F2.5 | At the end the game is saved with the winners order, time and level | `GameController.finish` → `HistoryRepository.save` (`historyIsSavedAndReadBackNewestFirst`) |
| F3 | Game history screen | `view/HistoryPanel` (with level filter and average time) |
| F4 | Question manager: view, edit, add, delete | `view/AdminPanel`, `QuestionEditorDialog`, `controller/AdminController` (`adminCanAddEditAndDelete`) |
| F4.1 | Security: protected from players, choice justified and implemented in code | [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), `security/*`, `QuestionService` (`SecurityTest`, `adminOperationsNeedAValidSession`) |

## Data and non-functional requirements

| # | Requirement | How it is met |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Organised classes and data structures for history, profiles and questions | `GameRecord`, `Player`, `Question`, repositories – see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| D2 | Security of sensitive data (questions and answers) at the data level | AES-GCM encrypted bank + session check in `QuestionService` |
| D3 | History in a fixed schema published by the course | `HistoryRepository` interface; the course schema = one new implementation, nothing else changes. **Waiting for the schema.** |
| N1 | Java | Java 17+ (built with `--release 17`) |
| N2 | Runnable file in every submission, works on more than one computer | `dist/EduLudo.jar` (any OS with Java 17+) and `dist/EduLudo/EduLudo.exe` (Java bundled); no external libraries |
| N3 | MVC architecture | `model` / `view` / `controller` packages |
| N4 | Design patterns | Factory, Builder, Strategy (×2), State, Observer, Repository, Protection Proxy – see ARCHITECTURE.md |
| N5 | Clear documentation | Javadoc on every class, README, ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY, this file |
| N6 | Edge cases tested | 63 automated tests (blocks, exact finish, third six, ×0 multiplier, question limits, tampered files, lockout…) |
| N7 | GitHub, all members weekly | see [TEAM_PLAN.md](TEAM_PLAN.md) |

## Bonus features (beyond the requirements)

- Computer players with a move-scoring strategy (`model/ai/ComputerPlayer`)
- Animated piece movement and dice; highlighted legal pieces; tooltips on every square
- Colour-coded game log; rules screen in the game; "Play again" with the same setup
- History filter by level and average game time; question search and filter in the admin wizard
- Admin password change, login lockout, session expiry, tamper detection with restore
- Windows `.exe` with bundled Java; crash log instead of silent failure

## Interpretations of unclear points (decided by the team)

| Point in the PDF | Our interpretation |
|---|---|
| Surprise "choose an opponent, roll, move one piece by half the roll" | The player chooses an opponent's piece; a normal die is rolled; that piece moves **back** ⌊roll/2⌋ squares (a surprise that helps the lander). |
| Movement after a question or a surprise ("+3", "back 3") | Not a dice move: it doesn't capture and doesn't trigger another square; it stops before an opponent Double Block, never goes behind the start square or past the finish. |
| Several single opponent pieces of different colours on the landing square | All of them are captured (each is "a single piece of another player"). |
| Turn order | Clockwise seating: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue (only the colours in the game). |
| Exact board drawings (start and arrow positions) | Taken from the description: Easy start = classic start square; Medium/Hard start = outer corner next to the castle; arrows = the end of each lap. If the official images differ, only `BoardFactory` changes. |
